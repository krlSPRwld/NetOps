# Homework NO. 2: Section Easy Wins - Create Summary Reports

This repository contains sources for excercises generated during the
[Network Automation workshop](http://www.ipspace.net/NetAutWS)

## Subdirectories 
* templates: contains jinja2 template for generating html-formatted output
* results: contains output generated by playbook report-IP-IFs.yml

## How to run this

The playbook is run from the parent Ansible directory with the following command: "ansible-playbook Homework-2/report-IP-IFs.yml".

## What it does

The playbook first executes filetasks, removing the entire results directory and recreates it.
Afterwards it checks for ansible.cfg and finds the reference for the inventory to ./hosts containing two groups, one for nx-os based hosts and another for gear running on ios. Please take a look at the [topology-overview](../../../topology/README.md) to understand the [results](results). Now facts are gathered by nxos_facts and ios_facts modules and html report files are written using a jinja2 template located in [templates](templates).

Feel free to explore, modify and reuse!
